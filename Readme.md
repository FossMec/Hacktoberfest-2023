#### Reporting Missing Scripts

If you want to request a script for a specific programming language that is not present in the repository, follow these steps:

1. **Create an Issue:** Click on the "Issues" tab in the repository and then click on the "New Issue" button. Clearly describe the script you want and the programming language it should be in.

2. **Wait for Response:** Contributors will review your issue and may choose to work on it. Feel free to discuss your requirements further in the issue comments.

3. **Contribute:** If a contributor picks up your issue, they will create the script and submit a pull request. You can follow the steps mentioned above to contribute your own scripts as well.
